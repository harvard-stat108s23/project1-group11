# Short Term Rentals 
The goal of the **Short Term Rentals Dashboard** in proy01.Rmd is to make it easy for potential renters in Cambridge, MA to access an interactive and specified visualization of available properties for short term rent in Cambridge. This data is compiled from Short Term Rentals in Cambridge, MA, published by [Open Data - City of Cambridge, MA](https://www.cambridgema.gov/departments/opendata). Short term rental (STR) will be defined as the rental of a dwelling unit of bedroom as residential accommodation for less than 30 consecutive days. The dashboard includes both a **Map**  (Spatial Distribution) and a **Boxplot** (Statistical Analysis) available to visualize and subset the data.
